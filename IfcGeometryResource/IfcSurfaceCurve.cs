Multiple representations provide the ability to communicate data in more than one form, even though the data is expected to be geometrically identical.<br><br>  NOTE&nbsp; The master representation attribute acknowledges the impracticality of ensuring that multiple forms are indeed identical and allows the indication of a preferred form. This would probably be determined by the creator of the data. All characteristics, such as parametrisation, domain, and results of evaluation, for an entity having multiple representations, are derived from the master representation. Any use of the other representations is a compromise for practical considerations.")]
