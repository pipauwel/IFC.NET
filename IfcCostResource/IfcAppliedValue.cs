Note: As well as the normally expected units of measure such as length, area, volume etc., costs may be based on units of measure which need to be defined e.g. sack, drum, pallet, item etc. Unit costs may be based on quantities greater (or lesser) than a unitary value of the basis measure. For instance, timber may have a unit cost rate per X meters where X > 1; similarly for cable, piping and many other items. The basis number may be either an integer or a real value.    Note: This attribute should be asserted for all circumstances where the cost to be applied is per unit quantity. It may be asserted even for circumstances where an item price is used, in which case the unit cost basis should be by item (or equivalent definition).")]
