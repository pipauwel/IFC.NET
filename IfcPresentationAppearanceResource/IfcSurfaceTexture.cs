For example, a scale value of (2 2) will scale the texture coordinates and have the net effect of shrinking the texture size by a factor of 2 (texture coordinates are twice as large and thus cause the texture to repeat). A translation of (0.5 0.0) translates the texture coordinates +.5 units along the S-axis and has the net effect of translating the texture -0.5 along the S-axis on the geometry's surface. A rotation of PI/2 of the texture coordinates results in a -PI/2 rotation of the texture on the geometry.")]
