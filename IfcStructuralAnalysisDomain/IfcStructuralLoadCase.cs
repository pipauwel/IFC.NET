These loads are not explicitly modeled as instances of <em>IfcStructuralAction</em>.  Instead they shall be calculated according to geometry, section, and material of each member.    <p>The three components of the self weight vector correspond with the x,y,z directions of the so-called global coordinates, i.e. the directions of the shared <em>ObjectPlacement</em> of all items in an <em>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</em>.  For example, if the object placement defines a z axis which is upright like the <em>IfcProject</em>'s world coordinate system, then the self weight coefficients would typically be [0.,0.,-1.] in a load case of dead loads with self weight.</p>    <p>The overall coefficient in the inherited attribute <em>Coefficient</em> shall not be applied to <em>SelfWeightCoefficients</em> of the same instance of <em>IfcStructuralLoadCase</em>.  It only applies to actions and load groups which are grouped below the load case, not to the load case's computed self weight.")]
